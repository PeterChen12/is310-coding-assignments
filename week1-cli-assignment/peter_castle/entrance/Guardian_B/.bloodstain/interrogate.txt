Ok I confess! I have been secretly seeing the waitress.
Our connection is profound and driven by true love. I implore you, please don't let her suffer any consequences for this. 
The bloodstain? It happened while I was trimming the thorns off a rose, a small token of my affection for her. That's the extent of my secrets.
I assure you, I have no involvement in the theft of the jade. 
As a suggestion, perhaps convening everyone once more to share information could shed light on the real perpetrator.
