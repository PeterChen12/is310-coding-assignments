Round 2 of Interrogations

Guardian A:
"I think Guardian B might be innocent. He seemed genuinely concerned."
"The Chef had access to all areas. He knows the security system too well."

Guardian B:
"I was just worried about the jade's safety, that's all."
"I saw the Chef near the exhibit late at night. Why was he there?"

The Chef:
"Accusing me? Ridiculous! I've devoted my life to this castle!"
"The House Keeper knows every nook and cranny here. She could hide anything."

The Waitress:
"The Chef and the House Keeper were arguing about something last week."
"Guardian B might be innocent. He seemed too scared to be guilty."

The House Keeper:
"The Chef often stays late. Said he's working, but doing what?"
"I saw the Chef with a strange bag the day after the theft."

The Driver:
"The Chef once asked me about the jade's value on the black market."
"Guardian B is just a scapegoat. I don't think he did it."
