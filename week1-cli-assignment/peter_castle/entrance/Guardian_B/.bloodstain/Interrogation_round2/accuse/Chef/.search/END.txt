Congratulations, Detective! 
Your keen investigation has successfully unraveled the mystery of the stolen jade. 

The truth has come to light: 
the Chef cunningly slipped sleeping pills into everyone's drinks, 
creating the perfect opportunity to steal the jade under the veil of night. 

However, you have triumphed in restoring Peter's treasured artifact, upholding the legacy of Peter's Mysterious Castle.
